<h1>HackerRank Solutions Repository</h1>
<p>
  This repository provides original solutions for various challenges in the domains of
  Python programming language, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Artificial Intelligence
  from the HackerRank platform.
</p>
<p>
  All solutions were originally developed by [Hugo Souto](www.github.com/hugosouto) without
  any direct AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT/GPT, Google Bard, Anthropic Claude, 
  VS Code extensions or others). IntelliCode-like tools, programming language references, 
  books, or generic web content may have been used.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This repository is a valuable resource for those preparing for technical
  interviews, seeking to improve their problem-solving skills, or delving into
  various domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, and more.
</p>
<p>
  The aim is to provide clear and efficient solutions with full explanations for 
  better understanding. For this, I tried to insert the data provided by HackerRank 
  in the code, so that it can replicate the 'Run Code' function of the platform locally.
