<h1>HackerRank Solutions Repository</h1>
<p>
  This repository provides original solutions for various challenges in the domains of
  Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Artificial Intelligence from the HackerRank 
  platform.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This repository is a valuable resource for those preparing for technical
  interviews, seeking to improve their problem-solving skills, or delving into
  various domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, and more.
</p>
<h2>Declaration of Originality</h2>
<p>
  The solutions were originally developed by <a href="www.github.com/hugosouto">Hugo 
  Souto</a> without any direct AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI ChatGPT/GPT, 
  Google Bard, Anthropic Claude, or others). IntelliCode-like tools, programming 
  language references, books, or generic web content may have been used. HackerRank 
  community-made or AI improved codes are added with the suffix "community" or 
  "alternative" in the filename respectively.
</p>
<p>
  The aim is to provide clear and efficient solutions with full explanations for 
  better understanding. For this, I tried to insert the data provided by HackerRank 
  in the code, so that it can replicate the 'Run Code' function of the platform locally.
