# HackerRank Solutions Repository

This repository provides original solutions for various challenges in the
domains of Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, and Artificial Intelligence
from the HackerRank platform.

## Introduction

This repository is a valuable resource for those preparing for technical
interviews, seeking to improve their problem-solving skills, or delving into
various domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, and more.

## Declaration of Originality

The solutions were originally developed by
[www.github.com/hugosouto](https://www.github.com/hugosouto)
Hugo Souto without any direct AI assistance (GitHub Copilot, OpenAI
ChatGPT/GPT, Google Bard, Anthropic Claude, or others), unless strictly
declared. IntelliCode-like tools, programming language references, books, or
generic web content may have been used. Solutions based on others solutions or
AI improved codes are added with the suffix "community" or "alternative" in the
filename respectively.

The aim is to provide clear and efficient solutions with full explanations for
better understanding. For this, I tried to insert the data provided by
HackerRank in the code, so that it can replicate the 'Run Code' function of the
platform locally.
